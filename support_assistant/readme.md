Approved refunds are credited to the original payment method within 3–5 business days, or instantly to the Zepto wallet if the customer opts for wallet credit. Personal care items that have been opened are non-returnable except in the case of a manufacturing defect. Return pickup, where required, is arranged free of cost by Zepto.",

{
  "answer": "Based on the retrieved context: Every Zepto order shows a live rider-tracking map from the moment it is packed until delivery, accessible from the 'Track Order' screen. Estimated delivery time updates automatically as the rider moves. If an order's status shows no movement for more than 20 minutes past its original estimated delivery time, customers should contact support directly rather than continue waiting, since this indicates a likely delivery issue.",
